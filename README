config.json is required to exist in this folder.
temp.xml will be created, or overwritten if it exists. It contains logging information.
A Python tool is provided for converting text files to the config.json variant. It
takes a files as its first argument and outputs the config.json through
stdout.
usage:
    python3 texttojson.py normalconfig.txt > config.json

Two example text config files exist: normalconfig.txt and exploreconfig.txt.
They should have nice comments explaining what they do at the bottom.
