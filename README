TODO This week: 1/23/17
Talktime: 40 mins
:) Allow key for action to be specified, instead of space
    -- look at unity list of keys in string form, let the string name of key
    be placed in config file
:) Change black screen after run to grey screen with plus from before, add
time paramater for it.
:) Individualy configurable times for grey screen

TODO Correct normal mode

Do these two together...
TODO Allow searchfind segments to be interspersed with normal mode segments
    -- allow for disabling of player despawning. A searchfind segment just
    means player doesnt despawn and no greyscreen is shown. -1 env or player
    spawn could me don't despawn
TODO Add landmark location param to searchfind config

TODO Fix landmark positions
    -- you got a piece of paper for it, and an email
    -- keep the triggers in the arbitrary weird order they're in, where they
    cross quadrants
TODO Add the smily guys as the sprites, in the email from 11/22/16
